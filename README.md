# E-Shop Project
An e-shop website, developed with the Spring MVC Framework on a WildFly 
server, in a 2-man team. I handled the entire Back-End part and the 
application's logic, including Controllers, Services, JPA integration, 
DB structuring, Entity management, AJAX Requests with JQuery, JSTL usage 
for dynamic content, and Cart summing using Java 8 Streams.
